From The Odin Project's [curriculum] (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

This is the creation of the google homepage as outlined in the odin
project's curriculum. I will supposedly learn:

1. Two ways to move a div around on the page
2. Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
3. Identify the background color of an existing webpage
4. Grab the URL for an image for an existing webpage
5. Center an element horizontally
6. Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
7. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific
elements on the page
8. Build a very basic form (even if it doesn't "go" anywhere)

This will be fun!
